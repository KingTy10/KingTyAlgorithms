Algo_Example is a bunch of algorithm methods, which in order are O(n), O(n^2), and O(1).
Going by method name, the reason GetPow is O(n) is because the Loop runs 'powNum' times, aka O(powNum).
Multiplication inside the loop is O(1), so total = O(powNum).
Has dup is O(n^2). Outer loop: O(n) . Inner loop: O(n) in the worst case. Total worst-case time complexity: O(n * n) = O(n^2)
getFirstElement is O(1) because retrieving a single element from an array does not depend on the array size.
It takes the same amount of time regardless of how many elements are in the array.
